Important:

Most types of records are also supported in REST web services. For a list of all records supported in REST, see [REST Web Services Supported Records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_1558962745.html).

Important:

For information about working with this record type in REST web services, see [Return Authorization](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_0718011926.html).

A return authorization transaction, also known as a return materials authorization (RMA), records information about an expected return of items from a customer, including the item IDs, vendors, quantities, and prices (which determine the amounts to be credited or refunded to the customer. This transaction is non-posting. It is available when the Return Authorizations feature is enabled.

For more details about this type of transaction, see [Customer Return Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N1302852.html).

The return authorization record is defined in the [tranCust (customers)](https://webservices.netsuite.com/xsd/transactions/v2025_2_0/customers.xsd) XSD.

Note:

You can also use the asynchronous equivalents of SOAP web services list operations. For information about asynchronous operations, see [SOAP Web Services Asynchronous Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3480635.html). For more information about request processing, see [Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Request Processing](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3444207.html).

## Field Definitions {#bridgehead_N3688862}

The SOAP Schema Browser includes definitions for all body fields, sublist fields, search filters, and search joins available to this record. For details, see the SOAP Schema Browser's [return authorization](https://system.netsuite.com/help/helpcenter/en_US/srbrowser/Browser2026_1/schema/record/returnauthorization.html) reference page.

Note:

For information about using the SOAP Schema Browser, see [SOAP Schema Browser](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3639052.html).

## Usage Notes {#bridgehead_N3688899}

## Working with Credit Card Data {#bridgehead_3946333758}

When working with credit card data, be aware of the following security features:

-   When adding a transaction that uses a credit card number, you cannot identify the credit card number using a masked value such as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*5151. You must enter the full 16-digit number, or you can identify an existing credit card record through a RecordRef. (You can identify the full number using the **ccNumber** field. You can reference an existing record using the **creditCard** field.)
    
-   Searches do not work if they include the operator **is** or **isNot** in conjunction with the ccNumber field. The only search operators that can apply to this field are **empty** and **notEmpty**.
    

## Initializing Return Authorizations {#bridgehead_N3688908}

You can initialize a Return Authorization from a [Cash Sale](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3663345.html), an [Invoice](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3678746.html), or a [Sales Order](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3690924.html).

The SOAP web services initialize operation emulates the UI workflow by prepopulating fields on transaction line items with values from a related record. For more information about this operation, see [initialize / initializeList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3508536.html).

## Working with Return Authorization Sublists {#bridgehead_N3688957}

The SOAP Schema Browser includes all sublists associated with the return authorization record. See the following information for usage notes regarding specific return authorization sublists. Usage notes are not provided for every sublist type.

## ReturnAuthorizationItemList {#procedure_N3688969}

To access per line tax fields, the Per-Line Taxes on Transactions feature must be enabled.

## Accessing Serial or Lot Number Data for Line Items {#bridgehead_N3688980}

As of the 2011.2 endpoint, code to access serial number or lot number data varies according to whether the Advanced Bin Management / Numbered Inventory Management feature is enabled.

-   If this feature is enabled, you must use the 2011.2 endpoint or later to access the [Inventory Detail](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3744760.html) subrecord and the most up-to-date bin and numbered inventory fields. You need to update any SOAP web services code from a previous endpoint that accesses these fields, to avoid errors or unexpected results.
    
-   If this feature is not enabled, you do not need to use the inventory detail record to access bin and numbered inventory fields and you do not need to update any related SOAP web services code from prior to 2011.2.
    

For more details, see [Updating SOAP Web Services Code When Advanced Bin / Numbered Inventory Management is Enabled](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3745415.html).
