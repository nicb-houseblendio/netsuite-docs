Important:

Most types of records are also supported in REST web services. For a list of all records supported in REST, see [REST Web Services Supported Records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_1558962745.html).

Important:

For information about working with this record type in REST web services, see [Inventory Transfer](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_0817112542.html).

The Inventory Transfer transaction posts details about per-location item inventory level changes when items are transferred between two locations. This basic inventory transfer decreases items in the source location and increases them in the receiving location, all in one step.

This transaction is available when the Locations feature and the Multi-Location Inventory (MLI) feature are enabled. For more details, see [Transferring Inventory](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N2308202.html).

The inventory transfer record is defined in the [tranInvt (inventory)](https://webservices.netsuite.com/xsd/transactions/v2025_2_0/inventory.xsd) XSD.

Note:

The transfer order is a more complex transaction that can be used to schedule and track the individual steps of the inventory transfer process through each stage of a transfer process in which items are moved from one location to another over a period of time. A transfer order, unlike an inventory transfer, can go through an approval process. For details about the Transfer Order record, see [Inventory Transfer Orders](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N2308766.html).

## Supported Operations {#bridgehead_N3678135}

The following operations can be used with inventory transfer records:

[add](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3480855.html) | [addList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3481360.html) | [delete](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3486046.html) | [deleteList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3486552.html) | [get](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3488543.html) | [getDeleted](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3497592.html) | [getList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3499748.html) | [getSavedSearch](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3503649.html) | [getSelectValue](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3504236.html) | [search](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3514306.html) | [update](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3527090.html) | [updateList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3527652.html) | [upsert](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3532463.html) | [upsertList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3533243.html)

Note:

You can also use the asynchronous equivalents of SOAP web services list operations. For information about asynchronous operations, see [SOAP Web Services Asynchronous Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3480635.html). For more information about request processing, see [Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Request Processing](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3444207.html).

## Field Definitions {#bridgehead_N3678375}

The SOAP Schema Browser includes definitions for all body fields, sublist fields, search filters, and search joins available to this record. For details, see the SOAP Schema Browser's [inventory transfer](https://system.netsuite.com/help/helpcenter/en_US/srbrowser/Browser2026_1/schema/record/inventorytransfer.html) reference page.

Note:

For information about using the SOAP Schema Browser, see [SOAP Schema Browser](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3639052.html).

## Accessing Serial/Lot or Bin Data for Line Items {#bridgehead_N3678420}

As of the 2011.2 endpoint, code to access serial number, lot number, and bin number data varies according to whether the Advanced Bin Management / Numbered Inventory Management feature is enabled.

-   If this feature is enabled, you must use the 2011.2 endpoint or later to access the [Inventory Detail](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3744760.html) subrecord and the most up-to-date bin and numbered inventory fields. You need to update any SOAP web services code from a previous endpoint that accesses these fields, to avoid errors or unexpected results.
    
-   If this feature is not enabled, you do not need to use the inventory detail record to access bin and numbered inventory fields and you do not need to update any related SOAP web services code from prior to 2011.2.
    

For more details, see [Updating SOAP Web Services Code When Advanced Bin / Numbered Inventory Management is Enabled](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N3745415.html).
